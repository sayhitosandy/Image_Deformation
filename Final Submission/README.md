### How to Run -- README

No Makefile or executable submitted as MATLAB cannot be directly run from terminal. Moreover, the project is interactive and would need MATLAB GUI in the process.

Instructions to run the code and view the results:

A. __Image Cross-dissolve__:
  1. Go to folder [Image Cross-dissolve](https://github.com/sayhitosandy/Image_Deformation/tree/master/Final%20Submission/Image%20Cross-dissolve).
  2. Run [crossdissolve.m](https://github.com/sayhitosandy/Image_Deformation/blob/master/Final%20Submission/Image%20Cross-dissolve/crossdissolve.m) in MATLAB.
  3. The output will be two images [im1.jpg](https://github.com/sayhitosandy/Image_Deformation/blob/master/Final%20Submission/Image%20Cross-dissolve/im1.jpg) and [im2.jpg](https://github.com/sayhitosandy/Image_Deformation/blob/master/Final%20Submission/Image%20Cross-dissolve/im2.jpg).

B. __Image Warping (Transformation with Single Pair of Lines)__
  1. Go to folder [Image Warping](https://github.com/sayhitosandy/Image_Deformation/tree/master/Final%20Submission/Image%20Warping).
  2. Run [imageMorphing.m](https://github.com/sayhitosandy/Image_Deformation/blob/master/Final%20Submission/Image%20Warping/imageMorphing.m) in MATLAB.
  3. The output generated is shown in MATLAB itself.

C. __Transformation with Multiple Pair of Lines__
  1. Go to folder [MultipleLines](https://github.com/sayhitosandy/Image_Deformation/tree/master/Final%20Submission/MultipleLines).
  2. Run [imageMorphing2.m](https://github.com/sayhitosandy/Image_Deformation/blob/master/Final%20Submission/MultipleLines/imageMorphing2.m) in MATLAB.
  3. The outputs will be saved in the folder [Outputs](https://github.com/sayhitosandy/Image_Deformation/tree/master/Final%20Submission/MultipleLines/Outputs). The output images will have prefix `rs`. e.g., [rs2.jpg](https://github.com/sayhitosandy/Image_Deformation/blob/master/Final%20Submission/MultipleLines/Outputs/rs2.jpg), [rs3.jpg](https://github.com/sayhitosandy/Image_Deformation/blob/master/Final%20Submission/MultipleLines/Outputs/rs3.jpg), etc.

D. __Tranformation between more than two images (BONUS)__
  For this, we run #C two times by making changes in the name of image files in the code. First, we use [try_sarthak_1.jpg](https://github.com/sayhitosandy/Image_Deformation/blob/master/Final%20Submission/MultipleLines/try_sarthak_1.jpg) and [try_sandy_1.jpg](https://github.com/sayhitosandy/Image_Deformation/blob/master/Final%20Submission/MultipleLines/try_sandy_1.jpg) images. The output images are stored with prefix ss. Then, we use [try_sandy_1.jpg](https://github.com/sayhitosandy/Image_Deformation/blob/master/Final%20Submission/MultipleLines/try_sandy_1.jpg) and [try_rishabh.jpg](https://github.com/sayhitosandy/Image_Deformation/blob/master/Final%20Submission/MultipleLines/try_rishabh_1.jpg). The output images are stored with prefix `rs`. We use online __gif maker tool__ to create a gif image that shows the process of morphing between the three images. Outputs: [three.gif](https://github.com/sayhitosandy/Image_Deformation/blob/master/Final%20Submission/MultipleLines/Outputs/three.gif), [three_fast.gif](https://github.com/sayhitosandy/Image_Deformation/blob/master/Final%20Submission/MultipleLines/Outputs/three_fast.gif).
