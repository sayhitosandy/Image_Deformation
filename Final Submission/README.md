No Makefile or executable submitted as MATLAB cannot be directly run from terminal. Moreover, the project is interactive and would need MATLAB GUI in the process.

Instructions to run the code and view the results:
(1)	Image Cross-dissolve:
	1.	Go to folder 'Image Cross-dissolve'.
	2.	Run 'crossdissolve.m' in MATLAB.
	3.	The output will be two images 'im1.jpg' and 'im2.jpg'.

(2)	Image Warping (Transformation with Single Pair of Lines)
	1.	Go to folder 'Image Warping'.
	2.	Run 'imageMorphing.m' in MATLAB.
	3.	The output generated is shown in MATLAB itself.

(3) Transformation with Multiple Pair of Lines
	1.	Go to folder 'MultipleLines'.
	2.	Run 'imageMorphing2.m' in MATLAB. 
	3.	The outputs will be saved in the folder 'Outputs'. The output images will have prefix 'rs'. e.g. rs2.jpg, rs3.jpg, etc.

(4)	Tranformation between more than two images (BONUS)
For this, we run (3) two times by making changes in the name of image files in the code. First, we use 'try_sarthak_1.jpg' and 'try_sandy_1.jpg' images. The output images are stored with prefix 'ss'. Then, we use 'try_sandy_1.jpg' and 'try_rishabh.jpg'. The output images are stored with prefix 'rs'. We use online gif maker tool to create a gif image that shows the process of morphing between the three images. To view the output of BONUS, please follow the path '\MultipleLines\Outputs\three.gif' or '\MultipleLines\Outputs\three_fast.gif'.

Thank You.
